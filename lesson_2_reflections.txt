R: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: The folder the git init command is run in becomes the top level repo folder
and all git services are now available here. It is required to actually use git
for that particular folder or project or file or whatever.
R: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area is different from the working directory because it contains a
version of the code that might be different from the WD. It is a way to save work
but not necessarily commit this work to the repo. The SA is different from the
repo because it contains files that are actively being modified where the SA
contains a version of "the truth."
